# Distributed_Measurement_System

The topic of the project is to develop a measurement system based on multiple ESP-32 microcontrollers. The aim is acquisition of  enviromental conditions & their visualization using a database, php and html scripts. Temperature, Humidity and Pressure are visualized on my website in AGH domain availiabe here:

ESP32 uC uses a 3 in 1 bme280 sensor to measure Temperature, Humidity and Pressure. It is also equipped in oled display to show results on the screen.
